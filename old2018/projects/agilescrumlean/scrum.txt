SPRINT
	WHO: Scrum Team
	WHEN: 1 month or less & short enough to minimize risk & short enough to sync with other work and events
	WHAT: "done", useable, potentially releasable product increment
	No changes to endanger the SG or quality goals
	Product owner can clarify scope
	Development Team responsible for SBL
	Cancellable: if SG becomes obsolete; By: PO; Completed items are reviewed; Incomplete items re-estimated, put back on PBL
	No sprints for tech debt alone
SPRINT PLANNING
	WHO: Scrum Team
	WHEN: 8 hrs/1 mo, shorter if shorter
	WHAT: What can be done, how will it be done, develop SG
	PBL items are decomposed to have enough work for the first few days, units of 1 day or less; the rest is refined later (PBL REFINEMENT)
SPRINT GOAL
	The "why" of the sprint, and measurable objective
DAILY SCRUM
	WHO: Development Team (and whoever they want)
	WHEN: 15 mins, daily; same time and place
	WHAT: Inspect progress toward SG, identify roadblocks
SPRINT REVIEW
	WHO: Scrum Team, stakeholders
	WHEN: 4 hrs/1 mo, shorter if shorter
	WHAT: INFORMAL; Demo and inspect increment, adapt PBL as needed, decide what will happen next
	RESULT: revised PBL
SPRINT RETROSPECTIVE
	WHO: Scrum Team
	WHEN: 3 hr/1 mo, after Sprint Review, shorter if shorter
	WHAT: Inspect team (people, relationships, process, tools), identify things that went well, create improvement plan; adapt "done" if necessary
	SM keeps it positive
PBL REFINEMENT
	WHAT: Add detail, estimates, order to items
	WHEN: Ongoing
	WHO: PO and Development Team (<10%) collaborate, at PO discretion

Management: support the Scrum Team and allow them to mwork within scrum as needed
Transparency, Inspection, Adaptation
Empirical process
"Done" is decided by the Development Team UNLESS there is a higher mandate already in place; if any Scrum Teams work on the same product, ALL Dev Teams must agree on one "Done"
PBL Items: description, order, estimate, value; test descriptions to prove "done" completeness
Development Team is responsible for all estimates

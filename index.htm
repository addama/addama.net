						<h3>Leader, mentor, programmer, Scrum Master, human, friend</h3>
						<p>Apparently I was born destined to help people get their jobs done. Every position I've ever held has either been in management or quickly elevated to management status. I have known a lot of programmers for whom that would be their nightmare. However, I've found that that is where I'm most comfortable: mentoring people, helping them through personal and professional troubles, hiring and training good people to do good work, and developing the cultures and systems that surround them.</p>
						<p>I served in the US Air Force for 11 years, during which time I held a myriad of jobs as a programmer. I was taught to learn, to understand that businesses are made of pieces, and that there's always a bigger picture. I have managed a constellation of UNIX servers around the globe, kept tabs on a fleet of 24/7 active vehicles while deployed, and safeguarded Top Secret encryption keys, as well as many many more roles. As I journeyed into civilian life, I found myself as a manager of people at a small software startup, and helped to not only hire and train nearly every employee hired after me, but to also manage projects, influence business decisions, and help shape the culture of our tight-knit group.</p>
						<p>I believe very strongly in the power and flexibility of doing things yourself, and I emphasize this in my interactions with others. I belive that the smart, capable people I hire are smart and capable enough to do their jobs without unnecessary oversight. I believe that taking an extra hour to make your own tool or library is worth the time over finding a third party solution eight times the size (granted the benefits are weighed). My goal is to empower those around me to be independent juggernauts, to have their own gravity, and to be brave in the face of uncertainty and change.</p>
						<p>My hobbies include seeking out new and sometimes strange music to listen to, target archery, video games, photography, and reading science fiction.</p>

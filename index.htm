					I developed a Python toolchain for clipping, re-encoding, combining, and captioning videos, primarily to use as reaction gifs and memes on social media and communications platforms like Discord, Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and even LinkedIn. The toolchain was built to be a config-based event queuing system with an emphasis on flexibility, repeatability, and customizability, giving me all of the power of FFmpeg and the Youtube API to deliver catchy, moment-appropriate images.
				</p>
				<p>
					I mainly focus on Kpop idol content, to include groups like VCHA, NiziU, Soojin, Chuu, Ive, as well as new comebacks and releases. My gifs tend to feature identifiable moments that reenforce the idol or group's image with little to no text on screen or speech if I can help it. My images have been shared by thousands of people around the world, and it's a great joy to (rarely) find one of my images out in the wild.
